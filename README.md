# MATLAB-Simulations
This repository contains single-script files for mathematics and physics-related simulations in Matlab. 

Useful for students who are learning to program or for anyone in industry/research who needs a multi-purpose code for their particular job. 

The programs are self-contained and do not require external modules/functions except for certain Matlab toolboxes including:
- Symbolic Math Toolbox
